# Code Runner
Code Runner is a full-stack project to excecute C++,Java,Python and Javascript Codes.

## Installation
You can clone the repo :
  ```
$ git clone https://github.com/Venu005/code-frontend.git
```

## Points to remember
1. This app uses [judge0](https://judge0.com/) for excecuting the code.
2. So get your X-RapidAPI-Key via [Rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/hub).
3. The backend for this website is built on express and mysql [GithubRepo](https://github.com/Venu005/backend).
4. I am on free tier for the backend. THe initial requests are late by 50 seconds, I request you to open the app twice for better results.
## Challenges 
1. [Rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/hub) has strict limiting rate for api calls. It took me some time to figure out.
2. Javascript codes that are subimitted don't always give correct answers, some times they fail too. Any help is appreciated.
## Contributing
